# Overview {-}

Today we will explore the critiques and alternative explanations for the phenomena of "Red Covid" discussed by the *NYT*'s David Leonhardt in articles last fall [here](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/27/briefing/covid-red-states-vaccinations.html) and more recently [here](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/27/briefing/covid-red-states-vaccinations.html). 

Recall the core thesis of Red Covid is something like the following:

> Since Covid-19 vaccines became widely available to the general public in the spring of 2021, Republicans have been less likely to get the vaccine. Lower rates of vaccination among Republicans have in turn led to higher rates of death from Covid-19 in Red States compared to Blue States.

A skeptic of this claim might argue that relationship between electoral and epidemelogical outcomes is *spurious*, saying somthing like: 

>There are lots of ways that Red States differ from Blue States --- demographics, economics, geography, culture, and so on -- and it is these differences that explain the phenomena of Red Covid. If we were to control for these *omitted variables* the relationship between a state's partisan leanings and Covid-19 would go away. 

In this lab, we will see how we can explore these claims using **multiple regression** to **control** for competing explanations.


To accomplish this we will:

1. Get set up to work

Then we will estimate and interpret a series of regression models:

2. A baseline Red Covid model using simple bivariate regression using the `Republican vote share` of states to predict the 14-day average of per capita `Covid-19 deaths` on September 23, 2021 

3.  A multiple regression model controlling for `Republican vote share` the `median age`  

4. A model controlling for `Republican vote share`, the `median age` **and** `median income`

5. A model controlling for `Republican vote share`, the `median age` `median income` **and**  `vaccination rates` 

6. A model using `Republican vote share`, the `median age` `median income` to predict `vaccination rates` 

Finally, we'll take the weekly survey which will serve as a mid semester check in.

One of these 6 tasks (excluding the weekly survey) will be randomly selected as the graded question for the lab.



# Goals {-}

The primary goal of this lab is to give you lots of practice estimating and interpreting multiple regression models.

Questions 2-6 will all ask you to do some combination of the following:

1. **Fit** a linear model or models using `lm()`
2. **Summarize** the results of this model using `summary()`
3. **Present** the results of this model or models in a regression table
4. **Interpret** your models substantively for other human beings

Question 2 will also give you practice visualizing bivariate relationships

In general, when we interpret the regression coefficients from a linear model we want to know their:

- **Sign** is the coefficient positive or negative? As the predictor increases does the outcome tend to increase (positive) or decrease (negative)
- **Size** is the change in the predicted value of the outcome **substantively** meaningful?
  - To facilitate comparisons between predictors, we will use [standardized measures](https://pols1600.paultesta.org/slides/06-slides.html#29){target="_blank"} of Republican Vote Share, Median Age, and Median Income, and Percent Vaccinated
- **Significance** today we'll put the cart before the horse, and say, coefficient that has one or more asterisks `*` next to it is *stastically signficant*
  - Over the next several weeks, we'll talk in great detail the logic and theory behind statistical inference
  - For today, we'll do a bit of "star-gazing" using these asterisks^[In short, these `*` correspond to $p-values$ below different thresholds. One `*` typically means $p < 0.05$. A p-value is a conditional probability that arises from a hypothesis test summarizing the likelihood of observing a particular test statistic (here a regression coefficient, or more specifically, a t-statistic which is the regression coefficient divided by its standard error) given a particular hypothesis (typically, but not always a *null hypothesis* that the true coefficient is 0). In sum, a p-value for a null hypothesis test assesses the likelihood of seeing what we did, if in fact, there was no relationship. If that likelihood is small (p<0.05), we reject the claim of no relationship. We remain uncertain about the true value of the coefficient, but we are pretty confident it's not 0.] as heuristics to help us evaluate the claims of Leonhardt and his skeptics.

# Get setup to work


## Load Packages

First lets load the libraries we'll need for today.

There's one new package, `htmltools` which we'll use to display regression tables while we work.

```{r packages, message=F}
the_packages <- c(
  ## R Markdown
  "kableExtra","DT","texreg","htmltools",
  ## Tidyverse
  "tidyverse", "lubridate", "forcats", "haven", "labelled",
  ## Extensions for ggplot
  "ggmap","ggrepel", "ggridges", "ggthemes", "ggpubr", 
  "GGally", "scales", "dagitty", "ggdag", "ggforce",
  # Data 
  "COVID19","maps","mapdata","qss","tidycensus", "dataverse",
  # Analysis
  "DeclareDesign", "easystats", "zoo"
)

# Define function to load packages
ipak <- function(pkg){
    new.pkg <- pkg[!(pkg %in% installed.packages()[, "Package"])]
    if (length(new.pkg)) 
        install.packages(new.pkg, dependencies = TRUE)
    sapply(pkg, require, character.only = TRUE)
}

ipak(the_packages)
```


## Load the data

Next we'll load the data that we created in class on Tuesday which provides a snapshot of the state of Covid-19 on September 23, 2021 in the U.S.

```{r data}
load(url("https://pols2580.paultesta.org/files/data/06_lab.rda"))
```

After running this code, the data frame `covid_lab` should appear in your environment pane in R Studio

## Describe the data

In the code chunk below, please write some code get an high level overview of the data:

```{r hlo}
# High level overview
# Number of observations and variables
dim(covid_lab)
# Names of variables
head(covid_lab)

# Glimpse of data
head(covid_lab)

# Summary of data
summary(covid_lab)

# Calculate standard deviations
 dplyr::select_if(covid_lab, is.numeric) -> covid_lab_numeric_columns

sapply(covid_lab_numeric_columns[1:10], sd)

sd(covid_lab$rep_voteshare)


```

Please use this HLO to answer the following questions:

- **How many observations are there:** There are 50 observations and 14 variables. 

- **What is an observation (i.e. what is the unit of analysis):** The unit of analysis is U.S. states 

- **What is the primary outcome variable for today:** 
Covid_19 deaths
- **What are the four main predictors we'll be using:** 
Republican Vote Share, Median Age, Median Income, and Percent Vaccinated

- **Will we be using the the raw values of these predictors or their standardized values?** 
We will be using their standardized values. 

- **What is the standard deviation  of our outcome and predictor variables:**
  - Covid-19 deaths: 0.407
  - Republican vote share: 10.3
  - Median age: 2.361
  - Median income:10287.6
  - Vaccination Rate: 8.99




# Estimate and interpet the baseline Red Covid model

First let's estimate and interpret the following model:

$$\text{New Covid Deaths} = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \text{Republican Vote Share}_{std} + \epsilon$$

**All you have to do is run the code chunks below and then interpret the results**  

When you visualize this model, you will have to **write comments in the code**

Then, you'll use this code as guide for subsequent sections.

## Fit the model

```{r m1}
m1 <- lm(new_deaths_pc_14da ~ rep_voteshare_std, covid_lab)
m1
```


## Summarize the results

Now we apply the `summary()` function to our model `m1`

```{r m1sum}
summary(m1)
```

We see that m1 returns two coefficients, which define a line of best fit predicting Covid-19 deaths with the Republican vote share of the 2020 Presidential election:

- $\beta_0$ corresponds to the intercept. This is model's prediction for a state where Trump got 0 percent of the vote. This is typically not something we care about.

- $\beta_1$ corresponds to the slope. Because we used a standardized measure of vote share, we would say that a 1-standard deviation (about 10 percentage points) increase in Republican vote share is associated with a 0.23 increase the average number of new Covid-19 deaths. Given that this per-capita measure has a standard deviation of 0.4, this is a fairly sizable association.

- Finally, note that last column of `summary(m1)` `Pr(>|t|)` both the coefficients for the intercept $(\beta_0)$ and `rep_voteshare_std` ($(\beta_1)$) are **statistically significant** (ie have an `*` next to them). 

## Display the model as a regression table

Next we'll format the results of `summary(m1)` into a **regression table** using the `htmlreg()` function.

Regression tables are a the standard way of concisely presenting the results of regression models.

- Each named row corresponds to the coefficients form the model

- If there is an asterisks next to a coefficient, that coefficient is **statistically significant** with a p value below a certain threshold.

- The numbers in parentheses below each coefficient correspond to the **standard error** of the coefficient (more on that later)^[A standard error is another one of those things that in the cart we're putting before horse today. Briefly, it is an estimate of the standard deviation of the sampling distribution of a coefficient and describes how much our coefficient might vary had we had a different sample...]

- The bottom of the table contains summary statistics of of our model, which we'll ignore for today. 

The code after `htmlreg(m1)` allows you to see what output of the table will look like in the html document while you're working in the Rmd file.

```{r m1tab, echo=F}
htmlreg(list(m1)) %>% HTML() %>% browsable()
```


## Visualize the model

Now let's visualize the results of our `m1` with a scatter plot.

In the code below, **please write a comment explaining what each section of code is doing**

- Replace the `#1. Comment for. ` with a brief comment explaining what the code below the comment does.


```{r m1fig}
# 1. pipes the dataset 
covid_lab %>%
# 2. Plots the rep_voteshare on the x axis and new_deaths on the y axis using the ggplot function and also adds a 'state' label to each point on the scatterplot 
  ggplot(aes(x = rep_voteshare_std,
             y = new_deaths_pc_14da,
             label = state_po))+
# 3. Creates a scatterplot
  geom_point(
# 4. Setting the size of the dots =
    size = .5
    )+
# 5. adds text directly to the dots on the plot
  geom_text_repel(
# 6. Sets the size of the text
    size = 2)+
# 7.  Aids the eye in seeing patterns in the presence of overplotting, method-lm calls on our lm function
  geom_smooth(method = "lm")+
# 8. Adds labels to the x and y axes
  labs(
    x = "Republican Vote Share (std)",
    y = "New Covid-19 Deaths\n(14-day ave)"
  )


```

## Interpret the results

**In a sentence our two, summarize the results of your analysis in this section** 
As republican voteshare increases, so does the 14-day average of new covid-19 related deaths. We could say the trend is moving in a  positive direction. 


# Estimate a model controlling for age

Suppose a skeptic reading the *New York Times* took issue with Leonhardt's claims, and said what's really behind the claim of Red Covid is that Republican states tend to be older and older people are more at Risk of Dying from Covid-19.

One way we could address this critique is by estimating a multiple regression model that **controlled** for age. 

$$\text{New Covid Deaths} = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \text{Repbulican Vote Share}_{std} + \beta_2 \text{Median Age}_{std} + \epsilon$$

If our skeptic is right, what should happen to coefficients:

- **Republican Vote Share:**
  - **Sign:** (Negative / Positive / Unclear)
  - **Size:** (Increase compared `m1`/  Decrease compared `m1` / Unclear)
  - **Significance:** (Significant / Non-Signficant)
- **Median Age:**
  - **Sign:** (Negative/Positive/Unclear)
  - **Size:** (Large/Small/Unclear)
  - **Significance:** (Significant / Non-Significant)


Explain your expectations in words here: Why and how should the sign/size/significance change on these predictors

## Fit the model

Now let's test our skeptics' claims by fitting a model `m2` that controls for Age (`med_age_std`).

- Remember the first argument in `lm()` is formula of the form `outcome variable ~ predictor1 + predictor2 + ...`
- Save the output of `lm()` to an object named `m2`

```{r m2}
# m2
m2 <- lm(new_deaths_pc_14da ~ rep_voteshare + med_age, data = covid_lab)

```

## Summarize the model

Now let's print out a statistical summary of `m2`

```{r m2sum}
# summary of m2
summary(m2)

```


## Display the model as a regression table

Next, let's create a regression table that displays `m1` in the first column and `m2` in the second column.

- To do this, change `list(m1)` from the code above to `list(m1, m2)`

```{r m2tab, echo=F, results='asis'}
# regression table of m1, m2
htmlreg(list(m1,m2)) %>% HTML() %>% browsable()
```

## Interpret the results

**In a few sentences, explain whether the results from `m2` support the skeptics criticisms or not?**

The results from m2 do not support the skeptic's criticism that age is predictive of covid-19 deaths as opposed to republican vote share. 

# Estimate a model controlling for age and income

Undeterred, our skeptic now argues that it's not just age that matters but also socioeconomic factors like wealth. 

Let's test this claim using the following model:

$$\text{New Covid Deaths} = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \text{Repbulican Vote Share}_{std} + \beta_2 \text{Median Age}_{std} + \beta_3\text{Median Income}_{std}\epsilon$$
If the skeptic is right, then controlling for age and income, the coefficient on Republican vote share should **FILL IN WHAT SHOULD HAPPEN TO THIS COEFFICIENT**


## Fit the Model

Please fit a model called `m3` implied by the skeptic's revised claims

```{r m3}
# m3
m3 <- lm(new_deaths_pc_14da ~ rep_voteshare + med_age + med_income, covid_lab)
```

## Summarize the model

Summarize the model `m3` using `summary()`

```{r m3sum}
# summary m3
summary(m3)
```


## Display the models in a regression table

And then display the results of models `m1`, `m2`, and `m3`.

```{r m3tab}
# regression table of m1, m2, m3
htmlreg(list(m1,m2, m3)) %>% HTML() %>% browsable()
```

## Interpret the skeptic's claims

**In a few sentences, explain whether the results from `m3` support the skeptics criticisms or not?**

The results from m3 does support the skeptics' criticisms because the 'med_income' variable takes over 'rep_voteshare's significance. 


# Estimate a model controlling for age, income, and percent vaccinated

Hmm, maybe our skeptic has a point. Let's estimate a model that controls for everything from `m3` as well as the vaccination rate in each state.

$$\text{New Covid Deaths} = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \text{Rep Vote Share}_{std} + \beta_2 \text{Median Age}_{std} + \beta_3\text{Median Income}_{std}+\beta_4\text{Percent Vaxxed}_{std}\epsilon$$

## Fit the model

You know the drill.

```{r m4}
# m4
m4 <- lm( new_deaths_pc_14da ~ rep_voteshare + med_age + med_income + percent_vaccinated, covid_lab)
```

## Summarize the results

Again, let's get a quick summary of our results

```{r m4sum}
# summary of m4
summary(m4)
```

## Display the models in a regression table

And add `m4` to list of models in our regression table


```{r m4tab, echo=F}
# regression table of m1, m2, m3, m4
htmlreg(list(m1,m2, m3, m4)) %>% HTML() %>% browsable()
```

## Interpet the results

**Briefly interpret the results of `m4`** 
The results from m4 shows that 'percent_vaccinated' variable takes over 'med_income's significance. 


# Model percent vaccinated in a state controlling for age, income, and republican vote share

Hmm, how should we make sense of `m4`. Let's fit one last model, that predicts vaccination rates as a function of Republican vote share, median age, and median income in a state.

$$\text{Percent Vaxxed} = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \text{Repbulican Vote Share}_{std} + \beta_2 \text{Median Age}_{std} + \beta_3\text{Median Income}_{std}\epsilon$$
Briefly, please describe whether we should expect a statistically significant positive or negative relationship with vaccination rates or whether we should expect no statistically significant relationship.


- $\beta_1$ Republican Vote Share: (Negative / Positive / No Relationship)

- $\beta_2$ Median Age:  (Negative / Positive / No Relationship)

- $\beta_3$ Median Income: (Negative / Positive / No Relationship)

## Fit the model

Now let's fit the model. For ease of interpretation, let's use the unstandardized measure of vaccination rates, `percent_vaccinated` as our outcome variable.

```{r m5}
# m5
m5 <- lm(percent_vaccinated ~ rep_voteshare + med_age + med_income, covid_lab)
m5
```

## Summarize the results

And summarize the results

```{r m5sum}
# summary of m5
summary(m5)
```

## Display the results in a regression table

Display them in a regression table

```{r m5tab, echo=F}
# regression table for m5
htmlreg(list(m5)) %>% HTML() %>% browsable()
```


## Interpret the results

**Summarize the results of `m5` and offer some broader discussion of what we've learned today**
Controlling for median income, there is a measure of significance correlated with republican voteshare and the percentage of the sttae population that is vaccinated. 
# Take the Class Survey {-}
